### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from Texas/Louisana with ~10 years of professional experience building enterprise software solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - a web-based [42 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(dominoes))
    - I'd like to see this have a mobile app as well
    - I'm using this app as an opportunity to play w/ Blazor
